Ninvae is a the result of a game project course where students from different areas of study at the University of Sk√∂vde collaborate.
In this project I acted as the lead programmer and Technical Artist, where I mainly worked with helping the game artists realize their vision through writing surface shaders, but also worked on:

```
 - Weather Effects
 - Post Effect Shaders
 - Optimization
 - Debugging
 - Procedual Texture Mapping
 - Behaviour Scripts for interactable units
```
Shader Examples:

[Water Waves:](https://github.com/JensLarsson/Botania/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Shaders/Water.shader)

[Raindrop Water effect:](https://github.com/JensLarsson/Botania/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Shaders/Water.shader)

[Flat Cloud Effect:](https://github.com/JensLarsson/Botania/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Shaders/Clouds.shader)
<img src="images/RainStop.gif?raw=true"/>
[Screenspace Mist Effect:](https://github.com/JensLarsson/Botania/blob/master/Assets/Programmers/Jens/VissualEffects/MistCameraEffect.shader) 
(This one sadly isn't implemented in the actual game due to an incompatibility issue with the game's water)
